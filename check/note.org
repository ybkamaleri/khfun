Some of the things that I have to remind myselv.
* DBI and odbc packages
Use these package instead of =RODBC= as they are actively maintained by people at RStudio. Basically
=DBI= is a front-end for ODBC driver and =odbc= as back-end to extract data from DBMS.

Some tweak:
- Specify /encoding/ to the =dbConnect()= 
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  db <- "c:/enc/DBtest/STYRING/KHELSA_dev.accdb"
  db_drv <- "Driver={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb)};Dbq="
  db_con <- paste0(db_drv, db)
  conn <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), .connection_string = db_con, encoding = "latin1")

  #+END_SRC
